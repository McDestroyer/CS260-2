I wasn't efficient at all, sorry!

Sorting is done based on character values, so the order is based on the ASCII values of the characters. The ASCII values of the characters are compared to determine the order of the strings.
This means that it's alphabetical in uppercase and lowercase separately, so uppercase letters come before lowercase letters.

Sort: (n^2) Sorting is done by going through each item and comparing it to each of the subsequent lines.
Insert: (n) Inserting is done by going through each item and comparing it to the item to be inserted.
Remove: (n) Removing is done by going through each item and comparing it to the item to be removed.
