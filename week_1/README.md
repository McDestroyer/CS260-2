The plan is roughly as follows:

	Create a marble class containing marble-y data like size and color.
	Create a bag class containing a list of marbles.
		- The bag class should have a method for adding a marble to the bag.
		- The bag class should have a method for removing a marble from the bag.
		- The bag class should have a method for listing all the marbles in the bag.
		- The bag class should have a method for deleting the bag.
		- The bag class should have a method for counting the number of marbles in the bag.
		- The bag class should have a method for getting the data of a specific marble.
	Start the program by creating a bag and adding some marbles to it.
	Begin a loop that asks the user what they want to do, including options for at least most of the above options.
	Include the option to quit the program.
	When the user quits the program, delete the bag.
